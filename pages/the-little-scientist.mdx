> The following post is a talk I gave to the Broadwater Southport Rotary.

## Looking up üî≠

Ever since I was a toddler I wanted to be a scientist; as a naturally curious person it seemed like a wonderful fit.
Ever since seeing a documentary series about the internal processes of the human body I was hooked on wanting to understand the nature of things.
I loved asking, '_why?_' so to get to do so for a living seemed like a dream.

Growing up I was obsessed with space, biology, computers.
I definitely saw myself as a bit of an outsider. People around me didn't seem as interested in questioning common assumptions about our world.

I continued to pursue an interest in science throughout school.
By the time I reached high school my choice hadn't wavered ‚Äîapart from a couple of months when I wanted to be "an actor".
I remember turning up to science club every Friday lunchtime to learn about something new and exciting.
Whether it was setting off small amounts of thermite or scaring the chemistry teacher in the next period because we left a few grams of Nitrogen Triiodide ‚Äîa highly sensitive compound called known as _touch powder_‚Äî drying in the fume hood, which exploded unexpectedly.

During my penultimate year of schooling I heard about the National Youth Science Forum (NYSF) and I was intrigued.
Here was a real opportunity to peek into the lives and workplaces of scientists, and meet with hundreds of other young people that were as curious as I was.

There was a process to get selected to go.
First you had to address a rotary club ‚Äîan international community organisation with many local chapters‚Äî and explain your passions; talk about why it might be valuable to go, not just for individual growth, but impact on the community.
Then you had to go to a regional selection day with many other students to present on a topic of interest and pass a few interviews. Needless to say my passion for science got me through the door.

## Kindred spirits

NYSF was exhilarating. A two-week whirlwind of laboratory visits, careers workshops, team building exercises, sightseeing and friendship. I chose the physics track‚Äîdespite wanting to do biology at university. I wasn't disappointed; we got to interact with professors in small groups, and received tours and demonstrations of many wonderful things like experimentally determining the mass of electrons or looking over the world's _most accurate_ clock.

The laboratories and experiments were _cool_ but the most exciting thing was being around wonderful, curious young minds.
Staying on campus at the University of Western Australia in a large, co-ed dormitory, we quickly opened up about ourselves.
I felt like, for the first time I was surrounded by a group of people **on my wavelength** ‚èÜ.
Everyone around me was passionate and had ambitions for science, research, intellectual pursuits.
I felt like I could open up and be my unashamedly nerdy self.

In environment like that you form so many close bonds in such a short time _it hurts to leave_. People nicknamed the feeling, '_post NYSF depression_' and I can definitely attest to having felt it.
However, I came home, with a feeling of kinship and belonging that I'd never felt before.

## Eject!

For 2-3 years leading up to my entrance to university I wanted to study **bioinformatics**.
Bioinformatics is the merging of computational techniques with biology research, an emerging and important field. I knew I had an affinity for computers, loved biology and had read about interesting developments coming out of bioinformatics like: personalised polypeptide antibiotics and the protein folding problem‚Äîrecently solved by Open.AI<Inline citation="open-ai" />‚Äî. I thought, "_this is the field for me_".

I finished high school and got accepted into Griffith university to study a double degree in IT and Science.
Biotech had captured my imagination but as I learned more about the nature of research I found myself hesitant to commit to a life of academia.

Navigating the bureaucracy and politics, the stale working environments, '_mimetic traps_'<Inline citation="mimetic-traps" /> and the pressure to publish with incentives of grant funding pushing people to claim ‚Äîeven unintentionally‚Äî positive results<Inline citation="publish-or-perish" /> repelled me like an opposing magnet. I think traditional research is critically important, but realised I required a path with a greater degree of freedom.

For 6 months I floundered trying to understand what I wanted.
My image of myself was _shattered_. I had always envisioned myself pursuing a path in research and I didn't know what to do.
In my first year the only courses that really intrigued me were the courses on programming.
Fortuitously, someone mentioned to me that Griffith was booting up a new **Computer Science** course.
We're in the age of individuals and small teams being able to create astounding value, working from anywhere.
Technological innovation is no longer confined to large institutions and companies with deep pockets, the limit is only defined by your ability to be creative.
I quickly enrolled to start the next year studying CS.
This decision changed the shape of my future as I embarked on a new and unexpected adventure.

## Foundations

Studying computer science I felt an emerging excitement that hadn't been there before.
Entering a new domain, with so many intellectual threads to pull on I was constantly exercising my natural curiosity. I learned to program. I learned how to push myself. Most importantly I learned how to learn on my own. The degree marked a destination and let you forge your own trail to reach it.

During my time studying I had two standout professors. I valued learning from their triumphs. However, invaluably, the most important thing to me was learning from their failings.

My graphics professor Ruben, regaled us with tales of starting and running a 50 million dollar tech company ‚Äîthat was big in the 80s! I've taken to heart his lessons on burnout, that it's not worth chasing money and materialistic frames of success, if the journey won't give you purpose.
My algorithms professor Wayne was brilliant, although his view on technology was bleak. He told us with a resigned sigh to prepare for the 30-year grind that our careers would become.
That scared me. I **_listened_** to that feeling, and I knew then that I couldn't be content pursuing a more conventional career path. I'd need to be able to forge my own path, full of intellectual exploration and purpose.

Finally, after the most stressful semester of my life. I finished my degree. I was working as an intern, starting to get a handle on: what programming was and what computers could do.

## The winds of change

By chance at my internship I met a life-long friend ‚Äîalthough at the time he was just a guy named Ben. Ben quickly became my mentor. Here was a person, whose zest for understanding was so infectious. He drove me to think deeper about what we were doing, what it all meant.

Ben was moving companies and suggested that I should apply. I got the job at the end of 2018. We started working together full time.
The following three years I felt my growth compound. We constantly showed each other new techniques, argued and tested our ideas and assumptions on one another. My thinking and philosophy had never advanced faster. Our minds aren't meant to reason in isolation. According to the modern interactionist view of reason, it's through interactions with others and our environment that we test our ideas and improve the way we understand the world.<Inline citation="enigma-of-reason"/>

## Tools for thought

Recently, I've been devoting a lot of my spare time to thinking about human computer symbiosis.
The world has experienced a long period of exponential progress.
The complexity of the problems we face have been moving in lock-step with the ever-increasing amount of information we collect. In order to progress we need to leverage technology to build advanced **tools for thought**.

## The rusty filing cabinet

The filing cabinet metaphor is common in the software we use. We organise files into folders, making hierarchies, taxonomies and classifications to determine where information belongs.

How many of you take notes? How many of you take notes digitally?
Note-taking is a powerful way to extend and remix our thoughts. However, we're being limited by our tools.
Information in reality is full of _relationships_. Thoughts don't **fit** cleanly in a filing cabinet since our brains operate on vast networks of interconnected information. If I say, 'New Zealand' our brains don't open the 'New Zealand' folder, experiences and related information come forth.

## Sharper tools

This is a graph. It's made of up nodes (circles) and edges (connections between circles).

<D3Graph id="graph-id" data={data} />

Any mathematics problem can be represented as a graph and, in fact, graphs can represent any set of information.

Our brains work as graphs. Of course, I am not the first to observe this associative structure.
Vannevar Bush, head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development during WWII theorised, '_the memex_', a system for organising massive amounts of information stored on microfilm. "The human mind ... operates by association,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúWith one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. ... The speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures [are] awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature."<Inline citation="dream-machine" /> Bush understood the nature of thought and imagined his system working _with_ the natural patterns of the human mind.

Even before the personal computing revolution, scientific thought-leaders saw power in creating systems with deeply linked associative knowledge.
Wikipedia is a modern triumph, spanning tens of millions of pages of deeply interconnected information. It's only recently that people have started to apply this thinking to a smaller and more personal perspective.

Enter **Roam Research**, a note-taking tool that lets you create a network of information. Roam completely abandons the filing cabinet metaphor letting you reference any page from any other. You're never stuck with the dilema of working out which conceptual bucket any piece of information belongs in.
Roam Research, and the emerging competition are taking Vannevar Bush's ideas for 'the memex', Wikipedia's idea's for indexing knowledge and remixing them into a new **tool for thought**.

Computational tools enable us to externalise our concepts and see them in front of us. We can explore our own minds like walking through a rose garden of ideas. <Inline citation="extended-mind" />
As your perspective changes it's possible to revisit and re-synthesise old ideas forming new insights. The patterns and relationships in your own thoughts become evident.

## The fox and the hedgehog ü¶ä ü¶î

In Isaiah Berlins essay '_The Hedgehog and The Fox_', <Inline citation="hedgehog-and-the-fox" />
he divides people into two camps, surprise, hedgehogs and foxes.
'_Hedgehogs_', are people who see the world predominantly through one lens or system of thinking, i.e. Marxism or Christianity. '_Foxes_', are more fluid, composing their worldview from a pool of smaller ideas. <Inline citation="fox-and-the-hedgehog-conaw" />

I used to think that I was a hedgehog under this classification; but, after seeing my thoughts sprawled before me, I realised that I am most like the fox. I don't have a consistent set of rules through which to look at the world.
I **constantly** decompose the world into ideas and models that I can understand.

In the past I experienced difficulty making my ideas fit into a more _unified_ vision.
Graph based, associative note-taking changed my life; it's true. Here's the graph of knowledge that I've built up over the last 12 months.

<BlogImage src={roamGraph} alt="An image showing an overview of the notes in my personal roam" />

Each dot represents a topic. The larger the dot, the more times a topic has been referenced.

Tools for thought allow us to apply the scientific method to our own lives. We can: observe ourselves, conduct experiments to test new things and come to new conclusions.

## 2021, the blossoming üå∏

I started putting **everything** I was learning in Roam. Linking new knowledge to my journal entries. Going through the process of entering information, and deeply associating, linking concepts together, showed me a lot about the nature of my own mind.

I've been able to trace the roots of anxieties I wasn't even consciously aware of having. I've had healthier relationships with the people I love, the people I respect.
Even the people I have a difficult time dealing with.

Thinking back on my decision to abandon bio-informatics I realised that it wasn't enough for me to just 'do science' if I didn't have a reason _why_.
I couldn't blindly work at progress for progress' sake without identifying a guiding North Star.

Now we've caught up to the present. Let me show you where my energies are being directed.

Through observing my own experience, and talking with other's I've noticed a few concerning trends:

## Communication: broken in the age of instant messaging

The ability to instantaneously communicate with people around the world has been transformative. Scientists can collaborate effortlessly. World events can be projected into the palm of anyone who owns a smartphone.
When it comes to personal relationships its never been easier to, '_keep in touch_' and I think that's becoming a problem.

<Definition
  word="Instant Messaging"
  topic="Technology"
  definitions={[
    "A written conversation over the course of time in the form of short messages delivered immediately."
  ]}
/>

About a year ago now I was thinking about why keeping in contact with my long distance friends over (instant messaging app of choice) wasn‚Äôt working out.
For a few months I noted how each IM interaction made me feel and had a few discussions about communication and instant messaging with friends and colleagues.
After some formative conversations and some re-synthesis of notes a few key problems stick out.

### Depth of communication

Instant message chains aren‚Äôt conducive to deep conversations. For a meaningful conversation to take place over instant messaging, the conversation either has to span a long period of time ‚Äîhours to days‚Äî or the messages have to be large. Trying to find a shared hour or two between people on opposite sides of the planet is a nightmare!<Inline citation="instant-messaging"/>

I love being engaged in interesting conversations, but I detest being chained to my phone for a few hours waiting for each short response and responding in kind. The fear of this has such a powerful effect; it stops me from beginning new conversations because I know I won‚Äôt have the time to see them through.

### Psychological pressure

I have an axe to grind with read receipts. Those little indicators that show you if, or even when someone has read your message.
Read receipts create a psychological pressure to respond **immediately**.
People will assume that I am being rude, or not attentive if I have, '_seen_' a message and not replied in a timely manner. Generally this causes my replies to be shallower and less thought out. I want the time and space to write long, considered responses. However, I want the people I care about to feel valued.

### Loss of information

We are too accustomed to the **impermanence** of information. I've never seen an instant messaging app that's optimised for storing, archiving and retrieving information from a conversation.
Messages are **obliterated** into the void under the deluge of new ones.
Popular platforms like Slack ‚Äîa successful app for internal communication‚Äî emphasise the **ephemerality** of information. How much context are we _losing_? How much time are we _wasting_ **re-seeking** instead of using effective archival retrieval?

## LetterDesk.app

If you found yourself agreeing with my criticisms of instant communication; I'm building a platform for you. [LetterDesk.app](https://letterdesk.app) is what I've been spending most of my productive free time on for the last eight months. It's an experiment aiming to bring the practice of letter writing and emotive, vulnerable communication into the internet age. [LetterDesk](https://letterdesk.app) makes a few simple design decisions to take the pressure out of communication while fostering self-examination.

1. Letters are delivered after a random duration of 1-4 days
2. You can't see when someone has read your letter
3. The software presents your letter visually in a way that lets you focus on the content

## Motivation found

Our ability to think is bound to our ability to communicate our concepts.
To come up with stronger ideas we have to share them with others.
To understand our purpose we have to understand ourselves.
Without Roam Research [LetterDesk](https://www.letterdesk.app) wouldn't exist.
The strongest factor of my growth has been: writing, connecting and re-synthesising my thoughts. I looked for a platform to extend this growth in how I communicate with others and couldn't find it, so I'm building it.

## The future of reason: facing exponential progress

Today our world is changing faster than we can keep track of, and yet we find ourselves stuck using linear, inexpressive 20th century ideas to solve 21st century problems.
We're drowning in information with no way to make sense of it, both COVID-19 and climate change highlight this struggle with alarming urgency.
We have to be able to augment our thinking to generate fresh perspectives and see problems with fresh eyes <Inline citation="camerata" />.
Just as we've built advanced and powerful tools to examine our universe, our challenge now is to build advanced and powerful tools to examine ourselves.

## Key Takeaways

This one is mainly for you Tanya. If along your journey you experience this deep gut sense that what you're pursuing isn't right for you. Change. Explore. I've seen so many people push through a degree in something they actively resent because they think it's what they _should_ be doing. It's never ended well. Almost all of those people have either hated their jobs, or switched to new pursuits after floundering for years. The right thing can still be hard, frustrating and gruelling at times. Most good things in life are. But if you have that feeling, no matter what anyone thinks, no matter what expectations exist around yourself, even expectations you've cultivated. Have the courage to change. Because every day you pursue something, that deep down you know isn't aligned with what you want, is a day wasted on this Earth.
