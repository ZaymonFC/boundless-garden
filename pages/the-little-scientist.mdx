### The cycle of writing.

- Thoughts and ideas onto the page.
- Reformulate into a central argument.
- Make the argument fit into a narrative.
- Don't spend time waffling, progress the audiences understanding of you and the topic.
- Don't push it if it's not working, rethink, journal and come back.

## Looking up

Ever since I was a toddler I wanted to be a scientist. As a naturally curious person it seemed like a wonderful fit. I loved asking, 'why?' so to get to ask 'why?' for a living seemed like a dream.

Growing up I was obsessed with space, biology, computers. I definitely saw myself as a bit of an outsider. People around me didn't seem as interested in questioning common assumptions about our world and the society we live in.

Transition this üîº to this üîΩ


I heard about the National Youth Science Forum (NYSF) and I was excited.
Here was a real opportunity to peek into the lives and workplaces of scientists, and meet with hundreds of other young people that were as curious as I was.

There was a process to get selected to go. First you had to address a rotary club ‚Äîan international community organisation with many local chapters‚Äî and explain your passions; talk about why it might be valuable to go, not just for individual growth, but impact on the community. Then you had to go to a selection day with 300 other kids to present on a topic of interest.
_Finish me_

...

## The Dovetail Moment

NYSF was exhilarating. A two-week whirlwind of laboratory visits, careers workshops, team building exercises, sightseeing and friendship. I chose the physics track ‚Äîdespite wanting to do biology at university. I was not disappointed, we got to interact with professors in small groups, and received tours and demonstrations of many wonderful things like experimentally determining the mass of electrons or looking over the world's most accurate clock.

The laboratories and experiments were _cool_ but the most exciting thing was being around wonderful, curious young minds.
Staying on campus at the University of Western Australia in a large, co-ed dormitory, we quickly opened up about ourselves.
I felt like, for the first time I was surrounded by a group of people on my wavelength ‚èÜ.
Everyone around me was passionate and had ambitions for science, research, intellectual pursuits.
I felt like I could open up and be my unashamedly nerdy self. This was a freeing and self-reinforcing experience.

In environment like that you form so many close bonds in such a short time, it hurts to leave. People nicknamed the feeling, 'post NYSF depression' and I can definitely attest to having felt it.
However, I came home, with a feeling of kinship that I'd never felt before.

## Eject!

For 2-3 years leading up to my entrance to university I wanted to study **bioinformatics**.
Bioinformatics is the merging of computational techniques with biology research, a new and massively important field.
I'd read about interesting developments coming out of bioinformatics like: personalised polypeptide antibiotics, the protein folding problem ‚Äîrecently solved by Open.AI <Inline id={id} citation="open-ai" />.

<!-- TODO: Finish Me -->

Post high school I got accepted into Griffith university to study a double degree in Bachelors of IT and Science.
I quickly started to realise that despite being intensely interested in the developments in biotech, the career and work style research in the space offered wasn't for me.
The bureaucracy and politics of academia, the stale working environments, '_mimetic traps_'<Inline id={id} citation="mimetic-traps" /> and the pressure to publish with perverse incentives of funding pushing people to claim ‚Äîeven unintentionally‚Äî positive results<Inline id={id} citation="publish-or-perish" /> repelled me like an opposing magnet.

For 6 months I floundered trying to understand what I wanted.
My image of myself was _shattered_. I had always envisioned myself pursuing a path in research and I didn't know what to do.
In my first year the only courses that really intrigued me were the courses on programming.
Fortuitously, someone mentioned to me that Griffith was booting up a new Computer Science course.
I quickly enrolled to restart next year studying CS.
This decision massively changed the shape of my future and I embarked on a new unexpected adventure.

## Foundations

Studying computer science, I felt the glowing embers of something that hadn't been there before.
Entering a new domain, with so many intellectual threads to pull on I was excited. I learned to program. I learned how to push myself. Most importantly I learned how to learn on my own. The degree was the track, but my own exploration of programming and computation was powering this train.

Fortunately my two favourite lecturers shared their ire with the current state of academia. I valued learning from their triumphs. However, invaluably, the most important thing to me was learning from their failings.

My graphics professor Ruben, regaled us with tales of starting and running a 50 million dollar tech company ‚Äîthat was big in the 80s! I've taken to heart his lessons on burnout, that it's not worth chasing the money, if the journey won't give you purpose. He's now tending a macadamia farm somewhere near Bundaberg.
My algorithms professor was brilliant, although his world view was bleak. He told us to prepare for the 30-year grind that our careers would become.
That scared me. I **_listened_** to that feeling, and I knew that I couldn't be content pursuing a more conventional career path.

Finally, after the most stressful semester of my life. I finished my degree. I was working as an intern and I thought I was starting to get a handle on what programming was; what computers could do.

## The winds of change

By chance at my internship I met a life-long friend, although at the time he was just a guy named Ben. Ben quickly became my mentor. Here was a person, whose zest for understanding was so infectious. He drove me to think deeper about what we were doing, what it all meant. Large important questions like, "why is it that mainstream programming hasn't progressed in 40 years?", "what are our minds? --think of a better way to phrase this---".

Ben was moving companies, and he suggested that I should apply. I got the job in 2018. We started working together full time.
These are the years that I have experienced the most growth. We constantly showed each other new techniques, argued and tested our ideas and assumptions on one another. My thinking and philosophy had never advanced faster. Our minds aren't meant to reason in isolation. It's through interactions with others and our environment that we test our ideas and get exposed to new perspectives.<Inline id={id} citation="enigma-of-reason"/>

## Tools for Thought
Time for an aside.

- Graphs
- Associative Thought
- Roam Research / Graph notes


## 2021, the blossoming üå∏

In the last 3 years I've had a lot of important realisations about the world and myself. I became aware that programming, isn't about computers. Programming is about thinking. A formal language for *intention*.
I now know that everything I thought I had a handle on coming out of university, I'm just starting to get comfortable with now.

I became much more aware of the patterns within myself, and the patterns surrounding me in the world.

Through observing my own experience, and talking with other's I've discovered a few concerning trends.

## Communication: Broken in the age of instant messaging

So that we have consistent understanding, I'm going to define instant messaging as:

>A written conversation over the course of time in the form of short messages delivered immediately.

- What is the problem

- Why not email?

- Reduce the barrier to entry, and give people a real space to devote attention to communicating with someone else

## Attention: The trillion dollar resource
- Dopamine treadmills
- Optimizing goal of 'look at screen as long as possible'
  (Show as many adds as possible without losing engagement)

- The science of attention

## The future of reason: against exponential progress.
- Echo chambers
- Exponential progress
- Strong opinions weakly held
- Our technology is developing much faster than our ability to reason.
- The personal computing revolution started with people (JRR Linklader, Alan Kay et. al) wating them to be true extensions of our selves and capabilities.
- The modern world is attention starved
- Communication
  - Tools for thought allow us to communicate more effectively with ourselves and others
  - See the patterns within ourselves


## Key Takeaways

This one is mainly for you Tanya. If along your journey you experience this deep gut sense that what you're pursuing isn't right for you. Change. Explore. I've seen so many people push through a degree in something they actively resent because they think it's what they _should_ be doing. It's never ended well. Almost all of those people have either hated their jobs, or switched to new pursuits after floundering for years. The right thing can still be hard, frustrating and gruelling at times. Most good things in life are. But if you have that feeling, no matter what anyone thinks, no matter what expectations exist around yourself, even expectations you've cultivated. Have the courage to change. Because every day you pursue something, that deep down you know isn't aligned with what you want, is a day wasted on this Earth.

- We're in the age of people creating new paradigms and worlds from their bedrooms. No longer are we shackled to large institutions or limited by funding to build and experiment with ideas.
