## What is this?

Boundless Garden is a place for me to let my guard down and tend to my thoughts.
Currently, this consists of a series of essays documenting my personal journey.

I'm enamoured by the idea of the extended mind. (üß† + ‚úçÔ∏è + üéí)

I know on a physical level the idea that _we are separate_ is an **illusion**. Our bodies are constantly changing, growing, ageing and re-synthesising from universal components. Do a person's notes, essays‚Äîexternalisations of concepts‚Äîstand alone as a little part of them? Do we exist across our perceptual boundaries in the things we project ourselves onto in the world? Is this a useful framework for viewing the world‚Äîeven if it's wrong?

These questions drive my fascination with software. Being here now, writing into my editor and watching a fragment of my mind pop into existence fills me with a sense of gratification.

I've always had a deep sense that creating software was somehow less meaningful than crafts with more tangible outputs. Invigoratingly, I've come to realise that software _becomes_ tangible by creating moments of connection. It can connect people with ideas and connect people with each other. Most usefully I'm finding the ability to deeply connect with _myself_.

## Okay, but who _is_ Zan?

Not sure. If you find out can you let me know? ‚ú®
